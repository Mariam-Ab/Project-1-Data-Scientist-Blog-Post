# Installations

### Technical: 

This project used the Anaconda Jupyter notebook using Python3. 

It used several packages that could be installed by "Conda" or "pip," such as;
* Pandas: Python package provides flexible data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data accessible.
* Matplotlib: cross-platform, data visualization, and graphical plotting library.
* Numpy: Python library used for working with arrays.
* Seaborn: is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

### Dataset:
The project used Stackoverflow Annual Developer Survey in 2017 and 2018.

# Project Motivation

Among three topics for the Udacity project, I was interested in Stackoverflow's data due to the countless responses each year and the numerous questions they've used in their survey. Therefore, due to the importance of IDE in developers' work, I was curious to know more about what languages and platforms each IDE user use. Hence, I analyzed the data using three main questions;  
* What is the most commonly used IDE from 2017 to 2018?
* What programming languages did each IDE user work with previously in 2018?
* What platforms did each IDE user work with previously in 2018?

# File Description

### Coding File:
This repository consists of one notebook that shows the analysis of the above questions, which is the ".iPynb" File.

The notebook is divided based on the CRISP-DM data science process, and all cells consist of clarified comments. 


### Dataset File:
* Stackoverflow's 2017 data 
* Stackoverflow's 2018 data 

Both files consist of "survey_results_public," a file containing the respondent's results. The other file is "survey_results_schema," which includes the questions and the corresponding column name.
